== Welcome to Landscape

Landscape is a very simple monitoring software that helps you visualize the
health of servers or external services on a single web page.

The initial goal was to be able to monitor multiple Monit instances on a single
screen. However, a few additional "Parsers" are included to monitor different 
types of servers or services, such as: HTTP, Amazon Web Services, HAProxy and
Twitter. You are encouraged to create your own Parsers if the included parsers
don't fit your needs.

== Live Example

You can see a very simple of what Landscape looks like at

== Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Rails 2.3.2 installed.
2. Run <tt>rake gems:install</tt> to install dependencies. On Ubuntu, you'll
   need to run <tt>apt-get install libcurl-openssl-dev</tt> first.
3. Configure config/config.yml. Examples are included.
4. Run <tt>script/server</tt> to start your Ruby server.

To use this in real world (TM), you'll probably want to deploy Landscape with
Passenger or Mongrel/Thin behind a reverse proxy such as Nginx.

== Creating your own Parser

Creating your own parser couldn't be easy. See the included parsers in ./parsers.

Only the 'status' method is mandatory and should return one of the following 
symbols: :ok, :error, :exception, :monitoring_error.

The 'url' and 'label' methods are optional. They are overridden by the corresponding
options in config.yml.

If you want to provide the user with additional details concerning the health
of a server or service, simply set the @details instance variable.
